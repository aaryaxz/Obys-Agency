# 🎨 Obys Agency Clone

A modern web experience built with clean animations, responsive design, and interactive elements that work together to create something both beautiful and functional. ✨

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Ever wanted a website that follows your mouse with a fancy cursor? Well, this one does! I've packed it with smooth animations that make everything feel alive. The text dances, images fade in beautifully, and there's even a video player that looks pretty slick if I do say so myself.

## 🛠️ The Magic Behind It

I kept it pretty simple with the classics:
- HTML (the bones)
- CSS (the looks)
- JavaScript (the brains)
- GSAP (for those buttery-smooth animations)
- A sprinkle of Shery.js for extra pizzazz
- Tailwind CSS to make life easier

## 🎮 Fun Stuff You Can Play With

The site has some pretty neat interactive elements. Wave your mouse around and watch the cursor do its thing. Hover over the menu items and they'll follow your mouse like magnets! And don't even get me started on the text animations - they're hypnotic! 

## 📱 Works Everywhere!

Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or that massive desktop screen, this baby will look good everywhere. I made sure of it! 

## 🎨 Design Credit

Big shoutout to the creative minds at Obys Agency for the original design. I just had fun recreating it and adding my own little twists!

## 🎉 Final Words

This was a fun project to build! Feel free to poke around the code and use it to learn something new. If you find any cool ways to make it even better, I'm all ears!
